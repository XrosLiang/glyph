# Glyph

This repository is used to publish all the code used for the following article:

[Xiang Zhang, Yann LeCun, Which Encoding is the Best for Text Classification in Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean?, arXiv 1708.02657](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02657)

The code and datasets are completely released as of January 2018, including all the code for crawling, preprocessing and training on the datasets. However, the documentation may not be complete yet. That said, readers could refer to the `doc` directory for an example in reproducing all the results for the Dianping dataset, and extend that to other datasets in similar ways.

## Reproducibility Manifesto

If anyone sees a number in our paper, there is a script one can execute to reproduce it. No responsibility should be imposed on the user to figure out any experimental parameter barried in the paper's content.

## Datasets

The `data` directory contains the preprocessing scripts for all the datasets used in the paper. These datasets are released separately of their processing source code. See below for details.

### Summary

The following table is a summary of the datasets. Most of them have millions of samples for training.
